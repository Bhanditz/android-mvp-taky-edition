## Summary

This Android Sample Project uses MVP architectural pattern helped by three powerful technologies
which are Kotlin, Dagger 2 and Room (from Architecture Components).

Additionally this project uses the Repository Pattern.


## How Does it work?

At first, searches users from local DB and populate in our users list, but If if we don't have any users then
we'll fetch data from Remote(our Web Service).
